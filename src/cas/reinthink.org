 - naive reingold tilford
  - recursive bottom up, after drawing subtrees of a node, shift them right
    as necessary, then center parent over children

(walk/postwalk (let [a (atom 0)]
            (fn [form]
              {:first-child (if (vector? form)
                              ["child" (form 0)]
                              nil) :form form}))
	      ["=" ["+" 2 3 4] ["-" 999  ["+" 992 2]]])

(defn naive-rein-til [tree]
  (-> tree draw-children shift)

 * shift is the quadratic part---requires:
  - finding the shift amount (requires traversal)
  - actually changing the x coords (also requires traversal)

for the shift, compare right contours of left subtrees to left contours of left subtrees
  number of comparisons is linear!

the problem, though, is traversals.  For this threads exist

threads have to be updated whenever two subtrees are combined

thread is just leftmost (rightmost) child, or given by thread
thread is only for childless

for actually changing the positions, each node gets a value called *mod*
when you "move" a subtree, you just update mod of its root
mod doesn't actually apply to its node, but to the children of the node

"Real position" of a node is given by its prelim. x + sum of mods of parents back to tree root

INCEPTION/INTERACTION
The thing is, for contour/collision detection, we need the *real* positions of the contour nodes.  But b/c of the mod stuff we don't have them yet

But we do have modsum.  So *leaf nodes*, which may have threads, have a modifier
attached as well.  This value is
 modsum(leafnode) - modsum (thread-destination-node)


WALKER

So Rein/Til was originally made for *binary* trees.  It can be extended to trees of higher degree, but naive extension piles smaller interior subtrees to the left

Walker came up w/some mods to rein/til to fix this, but they're not as performant as he thought
