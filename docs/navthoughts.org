what SHOULD it be?

selected -> keypress (direct-replace="d"?) -> replace selection


- commands:
  - delete
  - parenthetize
  - replace-with-author
  - treat-as-argument-to


but navigation?

[:=
 [:sum [:plus 2] [:plus 3] [:plus 4]]
 [:sum [:plus 999] [:minus [:paren [:sum [:plus 988] [:plus 2]]]]]]

down: if vector, moves to first.  otherwise moves to next (nil if not first and not vector)
children: if vector, selects children.  Otherwise gets next
right: if vector, gets parent and gets inced child.  if first, goes up a level then behaves as the vector case.  If not a vector and not first, acts like vector case
up: if vector, gets first child of parent.  If first, gets parent.  If not vector and not first, gets first of parent
left: if idx =0, go up until idx >1, then set to 1. 
      if idx = 1, go up until idx >1, then set to 1.
      if idx >1, dec idx


can we move entirely to real-path?
like, can we change matches-path
