* DONE "crazy toolbox" is what we want

* DONE live rendering of current, and live-rendering of doc, and



* DONE maintain history of expressions/equations

* TODO thumbnails of history

* TODO save hw @ every point




* disp the tree, disp the latex



* DONE right side a doc editor, goes straight to latex


* TODO I mean, the ideal would be some weird combo of paredit and a viz tool


* core operations that you'd want to do:
** replace-exp
** doto-exp

** do-to both sides
** certain simplifications
** "do opposite" of exp---given x+8=15, you'd want to operate on +8 and get x=7


** distribute
** combine terms
** break a term up (is this necessary, given replace?)
** undo
** write eq
