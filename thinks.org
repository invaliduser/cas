* TODO Delete-node
* DONE "crazy toolbox" is what we want

* DONE live rendering of current, and live-rendering of doc, and



* DONE maintain history of expressions/equations

* TODO thumbnails of history

* TODO save hw @ every point

* must have predictable, regular primitives of selection/construction

* "product" etc, should probably just be...a list?

* "list" should be a primitive you have, something like "+ 5" is a lame *mathematical expression*, but a perfectly valid *writing primitive*

* you *do* want some intelligence to prevent things like "5 +", though---removing 6 from "5+6" should automatically turn to "5"


* TODO one part a doc editor, goes straight to latex
** window showing the (unrendered) latex you've written
** window showing the (rendered) latex you've written
** latex window fully editable

* TODO I mean, the ideal would be some weird combo of paredit and a viz tool

* core operations that you'd want to do:
** replace-exp
** doto-exp

** do-to both sides
** certain simplifications
** "do opposite" of exp---given x+8=15, you'd want to operate on +8 and get x=7


** distribute
** combine terms
** break a term up (is this necessary, given replace?)
** undo
** write eq
